# Trader Junks

## Description

Trader Junks is a shopping application equivalent to that of an online pawn shop. For a user to purchse an item from our shop they must signup or login, then (atm) wehen a user decides to make a purchase on a certain amount of items, well hold onto the money until the customer recieves their package to avoid any scam. Once the package has indeed been delivered, the amount paid will be transferred to the seller with 3% taken off as means of buissness. This 3% is for the facillitation of the process. Additionally, as mentioned before, any user can offer an item up for a designated selling price.

## Installation
